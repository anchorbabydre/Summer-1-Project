      <h4>Technology</h4>
      <p> Technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life, society, and the environment, drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts, engineering, applied science, and pure science.
    </p>






      <h5>Computer</h5>
       <p>  A programmable electronic device designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations.

      <h5>Digital Divide </h5>
      <p> The socioeconomic and other disparities between those people who have opportunities and skills enabling them to benefit from digital resources, especially the Internet, and those who do not have these opportunities or skills.



  <h5>Problem Solving</h5>
  <p>
The process of finding solutions to difficult or complex issues. </p>

        <h4>flex-wrap</h4>
    <p>By default, flex items are single-lined. 'flex-wrap' allows the items to wrap as needed meaning the some flex items may move to a new line. The direction in which the new lines are stacked can also be determined. There are three option for flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse.
    </p>

        <h5>fLogical Thinking</h5>
        <p>Logical thinking is the process in which one uses reasoning consistently to come to a conclusion</p>

        <h5>flex-wrap: wrap</h5>
        <p>To see how flex-wrap works bring in the sides of your web browser until the flex items wrap to a new row. When just defining flex-wrap: wrap, the flex items will stay in order from left to right.


        <h5>Creative Thinking
        <p> Creative thinking is a way of looking at problems or situations from a fresh perspective that suggests unorthodox solutions.

      <h4>Computational Thinking</h4>

    <p>Computational thinking is a problem solving process that includes a number of characteristics, such as logically ordering and analyzing data and creating solutions using a series of ordered steps (or algorithms), and dispositions, such as the ability to confidently deal with complexity and open-ended problems. </p>



      <h5>Programing</h5>
      <p>Programing is
the act or process of planning or writing a program. </p>

    <h5>space-between</h5>
    <p>The flex items are evenly distributed along the line. The first item is on the start line (all the way to the left) and the last item is on the end line (all the way to the right).
    </p>

    <h5>Pattern Recognition</h5>
    <p>Pattern recognition, In computer science, the imposition of identity on input data, such as speech, images, or a stream of text, by the recognition and delineation of patterns it contains and their relationships.
